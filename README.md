# Pig Game
HTML and JavaScript game.
This is a 2 players game playing on the same platform.
Each player takes a turn by clicking the "Roll Dice" button, which generates a random dice. 
The score from each roll is added to the player's current score. 
The player can choose to "Hold," which saves their current score to the general score and passes the turn to the next player. 
However, if the player rolls a 1, their current score resets to zero, and their turn ends, passing the turn to the next player. 
The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins the game.
